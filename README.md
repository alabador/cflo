# CFlo
A finance management app. 

## Tech Stack
React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Firebase Auth, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Node.js

## Key Learnings & Optimizations
- Working towards using the single-responsibility principle. Instead of having large components and functions that do multiple things, I continuously work to refactor them. 
- Learning about JWT, as well as difference between Refresh and Access Tokens. 
- Using new tech I hadn't used before such as Firebase Auth.
